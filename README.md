# chat
simple chat app built using BigQ

## description
Download and run the server app and as many instances of the client app as you like.  If you wish, download the sample configuration files from the BigQ project so you can specify your own port numbers, GUIDs, etc.  

## performance
bigq is still early in development.  While we have high aspirations on performance, it's not there yet.  The software has excellent stability in lower throughput environments with lower rates of network change (adds, removes).  Performance will be a focus area in the coming releases.
